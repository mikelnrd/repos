<body>
    <p>This page tests the code as it runs in production. Note that this page could be behind auth or not deployed at
        all in a real world application)</p>
    <p>Check the console (right click, view console) and look for an 'all tests passed' message (or to see reported test
        failures). In a real-world application this would be checked automatically, failing the building and aborting the deploy on test failure.</p>
    <p>This is a lightweight approach to integration testing, where the full request-response cycle is tested. This
        approach tests that the API endpoint is called correctly and that the page's html is rendered as expected. Unit
        testing of the individual functions could also be added to achieve higher test coverage. Note that I have only
        implemented a couple of example tests for demonstration purposes.</p>
